# Module 13 - JavaScript Plotyl and Belly Button Diversity

## Tasks
for this module challenge we create a webpage with HTML and javascript. the page references an external javascript data file and provides the user with dynamically updated outputs and graphics based on a selection of the samples available. 
the output data includes:
- demographic info in a text box
- a bar chart with the top 10 count of bacteria cultures by OTU ID
- a gauge meter showing the number of weekly washings of the belly button
- a bubble chart demonstrating the count of each bacteria by OTU_ID. the size of each buble corresponds with the count (as well as the y axis). hovering over the bubbles will show the names of the bacteria types contained as well as the OTU_ID and the count. 

### Customizations
the customermizations I have added to this challenge are:
- an image on the jumbotron. I chose jelly beans. probably because I think belly and jelly, like the jelly bean company.
- added a paragraph very briefly explaining the page and data
- customer background color, font style and font color for the demographics data displayed. 

## Results

this was a challenging but rewarding assighment that combined many aspects of HTML and javascript. one particular challenge I ran into was my browser would cache the page/data so that sometimes it would not reflect my updated code. I leanred that 'ctrl+shift+R' will clear the cache and may alleviate some of these issues of non-responsiveness.
